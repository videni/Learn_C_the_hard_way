Learn C the hard way
===================

All these code are copied from the bookï¼Œ Learn c the hard way, which is perfect for developer who has high level language experience like Python, PHP and want to learn C lang. I am a PHP, Rust, Python also TypeScript coder, but know nothing about C lang , which I studied at college 13 years ago. I try to recall the C lang now, not for I want to write C code again, it is just sometime I do need to read C code. as an experienced programer, you can read all the book within 3 days. this book is full of working examples, you can experient with, which is useful for my case.
